**Shot chart visualization (*shot_attempts.png*)**

Shows spatial distribution of all shot attempts and their outcomes, revealing shooting tendencies and success patterns across different court zones.

Green circles: Made shots

Red crosses: Missed shots


**Points per Attempt visualization (*points_per_attempt.png*)**

Hexagonal grid visualization showing Points per Attempt (PPA) across the court. Colors indicate shooting efficiency.

This map reveals the team's spatial shooting patterns and identifies high-value shooting locations.

**Player efficiency visualization (*points_relative_to_league_average*)**

Shows individual player analysis with Local Points Relative to League Average (LPRLA) metric. Side-by-side comparison of two players:

M. Kaźmierczak (A): PRLA = 32.34 (positive contribution)

B. Baran (B): PRLA = -22.62 (below league average)

Circle size represents shot volume; colors show performance relative to expected efficiency.
